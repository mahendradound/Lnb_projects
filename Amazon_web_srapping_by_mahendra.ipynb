              "     <span> I bought this phone in sale in October-22, mainly for camera &amp; it's compactness. It's camera &amp; especially night camera performance is of top notch, similar to iphone 13. I have uploaded the samples. All three cameras &amp; front cam has night mode. OIS is great &amp; works at FHD 30/60 Fps on main &amp; ultra wide cam. You can shoot from 720p to 8k in various cameras. Portrait pics come awesome in all cameras. Colour reproduction is very natural.<br/><br/>Performance wise it's a good phone but SD 8 Gen1 still lags behind apple's Bionic A15 in numbers. Well you have to shell out additional 15k for iphone 13.<br/><br/>One thing that Samsung is still lagging behind many brands is bettery performance. I'm not a gamer, but on regular screen time this phone gives ~5 hrs continuous &amp; 5-8 hours intermittent usage depends on how you use it. 'Always-on-display' reduce battery life. Samsung has provided app sleep system for reducing battery drain by background app, which works great.<br/><br/>Charger that I use is of PD 3.0 standard by Dr. Vaku, which work great. Still take one hour (15 to 85 %) to juice-up.<br/><br/>In-display Fingerprint sensor here is ultrasonic, which does not work easily with tempered glass based screen protector. One has to press little harder. Dirty &amp; dry fingers are of no use. 4 out of 5 times I have to use passcode. But face unlock is very faster, so I use it.<br/><br/>Android 13 &amp; UI-5 is awesome. Many features like popup &amp; multi screens etc can be used at a time without any lag. Once I played Asphalt 9 Legends, game went on smoothly on Auto settings. Minor temperature rise observed.<br/><br/>February 2023 update : Now since 5G is available in my area, I tried jio 5g (SA 3700 Mhz spectrum) and speeds are astonishing, in 500+ Mbps.<br/><br/>Verdict : Go for it if you are looking for compact flagship camera phone in 50k range.</span>\n",

It's camera & especially night camera performance is of top notch, similar to iphone 13. I have uploaded the samples. All three cameras & front cam has night mode. OIS is great & works at FHD 30/60 Fps on main & ultra wide cam. You can shoot from 720p to 8k in various cameras. Portrait pics come awesome in all cameras. Colour reproduction is very natural.Performance wise it's a good phone but SD 8 Gen1 still lags behind apple's Bionic A15 in numbers. Well you have to shell out additional 15k for iphone 13.One thing that Samsung is still lagging behind many brands is bettery performance. I'm not a gamer, but on regular screen time this phone gives ~5 hrs continuous & 5-8 hours intermittent usage depends on how you use it. 'Always-on-display' reduce battery life. Samsung has provided app sleep system for reducing battery drain by background app, which works great.Charger that I use is of PD 3.0 standard by Dr. Vaku, which work great. Still take one hour (15 to 85 %) to juice-up.In-display Fingerprint sensor here is ultrasonic, which does not work easily with tempered glass based screen protector. One has to press little harder. Dirty & dry fingers are of no use. 4 out of 5 times I have to use passcode. But face unlock is very faster, so I use it.Android 13 & UI-5 is awesome. Many features like popup & multi screens etc can be used at a time without any lag. Once I played Asphalt 9 Legends, game went on smoothly on Auto settings. Minor temperature rise observed.February 2023 update : Now since 5G is available in my area, I tried jio 5g (SA 3700 Mhz spectrum) and speeds are astonishing, in 500+ Mbps.Verdict : Go for it if you are looking for compact flagship camera phone in 50k range.\\n  \\n\",\n",

I'm not a gamer, but on regular screen time this phone gives ~5 hrs continuous & 5-8 hours intermittent usage depends on how you use it. 'Always-on-display' reduce battery life. Samsung has provided app sleep system for reducing battery drain by background app, which works great.Charger that I use is of PD 3.0 standard by Dr. Vaku, which work great. Still take one hour (15 to 85 %) to juice-up.In-display Fingerprint sensor here is ultrasonic, which does not work easily with tempered glass based screen protector. One has to press little harder. Dirty & dry fingers are of no use. 4 out of 5 times I have to use passcode. But face unlock is very faster, so I use it.Android 13 & UI-5 is awesome. Many features like popup & multi screens etc can be used at a time without any lag. Once I played Asphalt 9 Legends, game went on smoothly on Auto settings. Minor temperature rise observed.February 2023 update : Now since 5G is available in my area, I tried jio 5g (SA 3700 Mhz spectrum) and speeds are astonishing, in 500+ Mbps.Verdict : Go for it if you are looking for compact flagship camera phone in 50k range.\\n  \",\n",

              " '  \\n  \\n    Except Heating everything is upto the mark as any flagship phone offers. It gives massive competition to iphone13 pro at very good price difference.\\n  ',\n",
              " \"  \\n  \\n    This is clearly a winner in most categories and ticks most of the boxes that one would expect from a flagship.The form factor is definitely the highlight. It's ergonomic and comfortable to use.The UI has evolved and definitely become one of the best in terms of functionality and oh !! boy that DISPLAY!!!There is no competition to Samsung in the Android mkt there .The camera 📸 is definitely worthy of the hype.Having said that ,the software does glitch and stutter every now and then ( even after the latest OUI 5.0 and A v13 update).But the biggest concern that Samsung really needs to adress and work on very seriously is the battery dpt.It's inadequate and poor for the catagory it's in and  price you are paying  . Work on some new battery technology, faster charging speed  or software mgmt that can make it last for at least 12-14 hrs without having to compromise on the functionality.The handset does get warm ( particularly on the top left corner and back side ) but nothing major.PS : Samsung can definitely add the travel charger with the box, you don't have to blindly copy your competitor,ya know .\\n  \",\n",

              " '  \\n  \\n    Everything in this phone is great. Except the battery backup. I have never seen a flagship phone with this kind of battery performance. Its the only con in this phone you have to charge almost 2 times a day and trust me i am a very light user. If you can compromise in the battery section then rest things are very good. If battery is your concern then go for s22 plus.\\n  ',\n",

              " \"  \\n  \\n    I bought it for 50k with 12 months no Cost EMI which is basically the best deal of this season. The reason I chose S22 is because it is handy and fits in the pocket.First thing first. battery life is a bit low. But it is working well for me as I don't play games or extensively social media. Also, the phone heats up a lot in doing anything processor extensive task.The screen quality is amazing and dark mode enhances the experience and battery life as well. LOL. The new One UI 5 further bought some usable features and the overall software experience is really good.Camera quality is great as it features flagship-level tech. Telephoto lens is another hot shot.\\n  \",\n",
